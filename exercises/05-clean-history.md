# Exercise 05 — Clean History (Keeping Changes Professional)

In this exercise you will learn how to:

- Understand why clean commit history matters
- Combine or fix messy commits before merging
- Make your Pull Request easier to review
- Follow the same professional standards used in real Parents for Scouting, Inc. (PFSI) projects

---

## 🛡️ Safety Reminder

This is a public training sandbox.

Do NOT:
- Add any real personal data (especially youth data)
- Add secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Discuss real people, real incidents, or real units

Only use:
- Fake / sample content
- Training-only changes

If you are unsure whether something is allowed, do not add it.

---

## 🎯 Goal

You will:

- Create several small commits
- See what a “messy” history looks like
- Clean it up into a small, professional set of commits
- Update your Pull Request with a clean history

---

## 🧠 Why Clean History Matters

Good commit history:

- Makes reviews easier
- Makes problems easier to find later
- Makes it clear what changed and why
- Looks professional and responsible

Messy history looks like:

- “fix typo”
- “oops”
- “try again”
- “really fix it this time”

That is normal while working — but **should be cleaned up before merging**.

---

## 🌿 Step 1 — Create a New Branch

1. Make sure you are on:

main

2. Create a new branch named:

cleanup-<your-username>

Example:

cleanup-JulesVincent

---

## ✏️ Step 2 — Make Several Small Commits

1. Pick a safe training file, such as:

participants.md  
or  
your profile file in profiles/

2. Make a small change and commit it with a message like:

fix formatting

3. Make another small change and commit it with a message like:

fix typo

4. Make one more small change and commit it with a message like:

update text

You should now have **3 or more small commits** that could really be just one logical change.

---

## 🔁 Step 3 — Open a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository homepage.
2. Click:

Compare & pull request

3. Use a title like:

Clean up training file

4. In the description, write:

This PR intentionally has messy history for the clean history exercise.

5. Click:

Create pull request

---

## 🧹 Step 4 — Clean Up the History

Your instructor or maintainer may show you how to do this using:

- GitHub’s “Squash and merge” option  
or  
- Local git tools (advanced users)

For this training:

- The goal is to **turn multiple small commits into one clean commit**
- The final commit message should look like:

Clean up training file formatting

---

## 🔄 Step 5 — Update the Pull Request

After cleaning the history:

- The Pull Request should now show:
  - One clean commit
  - Instead of many messy ones

A maintainer will review it and merge it.

---

## ✅ You Are Done When

- You created a cleanup branch
- You made multiple small commits
- You opened a Pull Request
- The history was cleaned up
- The Pull Request is ready to be merged

---

## 🧠 What You Learned

- Your working commits do not have to be perfect
- The final history should be clean and easy to understand
- Clean history:
  - Helps reviewers
  - Helps future maintainers
  - Makes the project look professional
- This is part of being a responsible contributor

---

## 🏁 Training Complete

You have now learned:

- Branching
- Pull Requests
- Code review
- Merge conflicts
- Clean commit history

These are the core skills used in real PFSI projects.

---

## ✅ Remember

Clean history is not about ego or perfection.  
It is about **making the project safe, understandable, and maintainable for the next person**.
