# Exercise 03 — Code Review (Working Like a Maintainer)

In this exercise you will learn how to:

- Review someone else’s Pull Request (PR)
- Leave clear, professional feedback
- Request changes when needed
- Approve a Pull Request when it meets requirements
- Practice the same review process used in real Parents for Scouting, Inc. (PFSI) projects

---

## 🛡️ Safety Reminder

This is a public training sandbox.

Do NOT:
- Add any real personal data (especially youth data)
- Add secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Discuss real people, real incidents, or real units

Only use:
- Fake / sample content
- Training-only discussion

If you are unsure whether something is allowed, do not post it.

---

## 🎯 Goal

You will:

- Review another participant’s Pull Request
- Leave at least one helpful comment
- Either approve the Pull Request or request a change
- Learn how maintainers protect quality and safety

---

## 🧱 Step 1 — Find a Pull Request to Review

1. Go to the repository homepage.
2. Click the tab:

Pull requests

3. Open a Pull Request created by another participant (for example, their profile file from Exercise 02).

---

## 🔍 Step 2 — Read the Pull Request Carefully

Before commenting, review:

- The list of changed files
- The content of the changes
- The Pull Request description

Check specifically:

- Does it contain any personal data?
- Does it contain any secrets or unsafe content?
- Does it follow the instructions from the exercise?
- Is it clear and well-written?

---

## ✏️ Step 3 — Leave a Review Comment

1. Click:

Files changed

2. Click the plus icon next to a line to add a comment.

Write a helpful, professional comment, for example:

- Compliment something that was done well
- Or point out something that should be fixed

Example comments:

- "This looks good and follows the exercise instructions."
- "Please remove this line because it might look like personal information, even if it is fake."
- "Can you fix this typo before we merge?"

---

## 🔁 Step 4 — Submit Your Review

1. Click:

Review changes

2. Choose one:

- Approve (if everything looks good and follows the rules)
- Request changes (if something needs to be fixed)

3. In the review summary box, write a short, professional message, for example:

- "Looks good and follows the training rules. Nice work."
- "Please fix the noted issue and then I can approve."

4. Click:

Submit review

---

## 🔄 Step 5 — Follow Up (If You Requested Changes)

If you requested changes:

- Wait for the author to update their PR
- When they respond, review the changes again
- If everything is now correct, submit another review and approve it

---

## ✅ You Are Done When

- You reviewed at least one Pull Request
- You left at least one helpful comment
- You submitted a review (approve or request changes)
- You understand how review protects quality and safety

---

## 🧠 What You Learned

- Code review is not criticism, it is collaboration
- Reviews protect:
  - Quality
  - Safety
  - Policy compliance
- Maintainers act as guardians of the project, not gatekeepers
- This process is part of PFSI’s governance model
