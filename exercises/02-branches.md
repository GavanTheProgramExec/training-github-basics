# Exercise 02 — Branches (Working Like PFSI Projects)

In this exercise you will learn how to:

- Create a new branch from `main`
- Make **multiple commits**
- Update an existing Pull Request (PR)
- Keep your work organized and reviewable

This is how most real PFSI work will happen.

---

## 🛡️ Safety Reminder

This is a **public training sandbox**.

❌ Do NOT:
- Add any real personal data (especially youth data)
- Add secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Upload screenshots that contain personal info

✅ Use only:
- Fake/sample content
- Training-only changes

---

## 🎯 Goal

You will add a short “About Me” training file under `profiles/` using **two separate commits**.

---

## ✅ What You Will Create

A new file:

profiles/<your-github-username>.md  


Example:

profiles/JulesVincent.md


---

## 🧱 Step 1 — Sync Yourself to `main`

Before starting, make sure you are working from the latest `main`.

### If you are using GitHub website only:
- Go to the repository homepage
- Ensure the branch dropdown is set to `main`

---

## 🌿 Step 2 — Create a New Branch

Create a branch named:

profile-<your-username>


Example:

profile-JulesVincent


---

## ✏️ Step 3 — Commit #1 (Create Your Profile File)

### 3.1 Create the file

1. Click:
> Add file → Create new file

2. In the filename box, enter:
- (Example: Documentation)

profiles/<your-username>.md  

Example:

profiles/JulesVincent.md  


---

### 3.2 Paste This EXACT Example (Then Edit the Name If Needed)

Paste this into the editor:

```markdown
# Jules Vincent

## What I'm Learning
- GitHub branches and pull requests
- How to collaborate safely in PFSI projects

## Interests (Training-Safe)
- Robotics / STEM
- Programming
- Documentation

⚠️ You may change the name and interests, but:

Do NOT add contact info

Do NOT mention real people

Do NOT add troop info

---

### 3.3 Commit the File

Scroll down and use:

Commit message:

Add training profile for JulesVincent

Make sure:

✅ Commit to the profile-JulesVincent branch

Click:

Commit changes

---

## ✏️ Step 4 — Commit #2 (Update Your Profile)

1. Open your file again:

profiles/JulesVincent.md

2. Click:

✏️ Edit

3. Add this section at the bottom:

## Practice Notes
- I created a branch from main.
- I made two commits before opening a Pull Request.
- I understand my changes must be reviewed before merging.

4. Scroll down and commit with:

Commit message:

Update profile with practice notes

Click:

Commit changes

##Step 5 — Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go back to the repository homepage

2. Click:

Compare & pull request

3. Use this title:

Add training profile for JulesVincent

4. In the description, write something like:  

This adds my training profile in two commits. No personal data or secrets included.

5. Click:

Create pull request

## 👀 Step 6 — Review

- A maintainer will review your PR

- They may approve it or request a small change

- If changes are requested:

    - Edit the file

    - Commit again to the same branch

    - The PR updates automatically

---
🧠 What You Learned

Branches isolate work safely

Multiple commits make reviews easier

Pull Requests are how PFSI collaborates
