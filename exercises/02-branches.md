# Exercise 02 — Branches (Working Like Real PFSI Projects)

In this exercise you will learn how to:

- Create a new branch from `main`
- Make multiple commits
- Update work before review
- Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Work the same way you will in real Parents for Scouting, Inc. (PFSI) projects

---

## 🛡️ Safety Reminder

This is a public training sandbox.

Do NOT:
- Add any real personal data (especially youth data)
- Add secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Upload screenshots that contain personal info

Only use:
- Fake / sample content
- Training-only changes

If you are unsure whether something is allowed, do not add it.

---

## 🎯 Goal

You will:

- Create a new branch from `main`
- Create a training profile file
- Make two separate commits
- Open a Pull Request for review

---

## 📁 What You Will Create

You will create a new file named:

profiles/<your-github-username>.md

Example:

profiles/JulesVincent.md

---

## 🧱 Step 1 — Make Sure You Are On main

1. Go to the repository homepage.
2. Use the branch dropdown and make sure it is set to:

main

This ensures you start from the latest approved version.

---

## 🌿 Step 2 — Create a New Branch

1. Click the branch dropdown.
2. Type a new branch name:

profile-<your-username>

Example:

profile-JulesVincent

3. Click:

Create branch

You are now working in your own safe workspace.

---

## ✏️ Step 3 — Commit #1 (Create Your Profile File)

### 3.1 Create the File

1. Click:

Add file → Create new file

2. In the filename box, enter:

profiles/<your-username>.md

Example:

profiles/JulesVincent.md

---

### 3.2 Paste This Example (Then Edit the Name If Needed)

Paste the following into the editor:

# Jules Vincent

## What I'm Learning
- GitHub branches and pull requests
- How to collaborate safely in PFSI projects

## Interests (Training-Safe)
- Robotics / STEM
- Programming
- Documentation

You may change the name and interests, but:

- Do NOT add contact information
- Do NOT mention other people
- Do NOT add troop or unit information

---

### 3.3 Commit the File

Scroll down and enter this commit message:

Add training profile for JulesVincent

Make sure it says you are committing to:

profile-JulesVincent

Then click:

Commit changes

---

## ✏️ Step 4 — Commit #2 (Update Your Profile)

Now you will make a second commit to the same file.

1. Open your file again:

profiles/JulesVincent.md

2. Click:

Edit

3. Add this section at the bottom of the file:

## Practice Notes
- I created a branch from main.
- I made two commits before opening a Pull Request.
- I understand my changes must be reviewed before merging.

4. Scroll down and commit with this message:

Update profile with practice notes

Make sure you are still committing to:

profile-JulesVincent

Click:

Commit changes

---

## 🔁 Step 5 — Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go back to the repository homepage.
2. Click:

Compare & pull request

3. Use this title:

Add training profile for JulesVincent

4. In the description, write something like:

This adds my training profile in two commits. No personal data or secrets included.

5. Click:

Create pull request

---

## 👀 Step 6 — Review and Updates

A maintainer or instructor will review your Pull Request.

They may:
- Approve it
- Or request a small change

If changes are requested:
- Go back to your branch
- Make the fix
- Commit again to the same branch

Your Pull Request will update automatically.

---

## ✅ You Are Done When

- You created branch profile-<your-username>
- You created profiles/<your-username>.md
- You made two commits
- You opened a Pull Request
- The Pull Request was approved and merged (or marked complete by the instructor)

---

## 🧠 What You Learned

- Branches isolate work safely
- Multiple commits make changes easier to review
- Pull Requests are how PFSI collaborates
- This is the same workflow used in real PFSI projects

---

## 🏁 Next Exercise

Proceed to:

exercises/03-code-review.md

## ✅ Remember

The process (branch → commits → PR → review) is part of PFSI’s safety, quality, and governance model. Always follow it, even for small changes.
