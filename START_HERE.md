## 🎯 What You Will Learn

By completing this guide, you will learn how to:

- Create a branch

- Commit your work
- Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Go through review and merge

---

## 🧭 The PFSI Workflow (Very Important)

In PFSI projects:

> ❌ You never commit directly to `main`

You always:

1. Create a branch  
2. Make your changes  
3. Open a Pull Request  
4. Get it reviewed  
5. Then it gets merged  

This ensures:
- Oversight
- Safety
- Quality
- An audit trail

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Your First Contribution

### Step 1 — Create Your Branch

1. Go to the main page of this repository
2. Click the branch dropdown (it probably says `main`)
3. Type a new branch name like:

training-yourname

Example:

training-Jules

4. Click:
> **Create branch**

---

### Step 2 — Find the Training File

1. Open the folder:

exercises/


2. Click:

01-first-pr.md


3. Follow the instructions inside that file

(It will ask you to make a small, safe change.)

---

### Step 3 — Make Your Edit

1. Click the ✏️ **Edit** button on the file you’re told to change
2. Make the requested change
3. Scroll down to the bottom
4. In the commit box:
   - Title:  
     ```
     Complete first training exercise
     ```
5. Make sure:
   - ✅ “Commit directly to your branch” is selected
6. Click:
> **Commit changes**

---

### Step 4 — Open Your Pull Request (PR)

1. Go back to the main page of the repository
2. You should see a banner offering to open a Pull Request
3. Click:
> **Compare & pull request**

4. Fill in the PR description
5. Confirm the checklist
6. Click:
> **Create pull request**

---

### Step 5 — Wait for Review

- An adult maintainer or instructor will:
  - Review your PR
  - Possibly leave comments
- You may be asked to:
  - Fix something
  - Update your branch

This is normal and part of the process.

---

### Step 6 — Merge (or Instructor Will Merge)

Once approved:
- The PR will be merged into `main`
- 🎉 You have completed your first PFSI-style contribution!

---

## 🧠 Important Rules to Remember

- All PFSI work happens in:
  - Issues
  - Pull Requests
- ❌ No private messages for PFSI work
- ❌ No real data, ever
- ✅ Assume everything is logged and reviewable

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

- Ask your instructor or maintainer
- Or open an **Issue** in this repo describing what you’re stuck on

Do not:
- Work around the process
- Use side channels for project work

---

## 🏁 What’s Next?

After you finish this:

➡️ Go to:

exercises/02-branches.md


to learn more about working with branches and multiple commits.

---

## ✅ Remember

> This repository is a **public training sandbox**.  
> Safety, professionalism, and following the process matter more than speed.
