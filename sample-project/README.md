This folder contains a **fake, training-only project** used by Parents for Scouting, Inc. (PFSI) to teach GitHub workflows.

⚠️ **This is NOT a real application.**  
⚠️ **This project contains NO real data.**  
⚠️ **Everything here is for training and practice only.**

## 🎯 Purpose

This sample project exists to give you a **safe place to practice**:

- Editing files
- Creating branches
- Making commits
- Opening Pull Requests (PRs)
- Reviewing changes
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Cleaning up commit history

All without any risk to real systems or real information.

## 🛡️ Safety Rules

This is a **public training sandbox**.

Do NOT:
- Add any real personal data (especially youth data)
- Add passwords, API keys, tokens, or secrets
- Add screenshots containing real information
- Turn this into a real project

Only use:
- Fake/sample data
- Training-only content
- Clearly fictional examples

If you are not sure whether something is allowed, **do not add it**.
